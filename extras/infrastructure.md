# Infrastructure Guide

## Compute Resources

Lab members are provided with a laptop or desktop.
For rotation and undergraduate students, these machines (e.g. desktop) may be shared.
For full time lab members, the operating system should be reinstalled when the member joins.
Large-scale computation and web hosting are performed via [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu) or [MARCC](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu).
Please discuss your project's computing needs with Casey to best optimize resource usage.

## Accounts

When a lab member joins, accounts should be created in:

- [JHU Biostats Slack](http://jhubiostat.slack.com)
- [JHU Genomics Slack](http://jhu-genomics.slack.com)

In addition, lab members should have accounts with 
[GitHub](https://github.com).
