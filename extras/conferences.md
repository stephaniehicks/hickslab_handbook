Conferences are an excellent way to present your science broadly and learn about new ideas. All lab members are encouraged to attend conferences regularly. Once you have been in the lab for at least six months, Stephanie will pay for one conference per year. This is a minimum commitment; we can discuss additional travel. Please use funds responsibly; this includes using early registration discounts and sharing rooms, if reasonable. Costs are reimbursed after the conference, but certain expenses can be reimbursed right away. The lab only covers charges directly associated with work, such as lodging, registration, poster printing, and food during the conference days; if you stay extra days for personal time, all expenses will be your responsibility.
 
Expectations:

+ Travel must be preapproved by Stephanie
+ You are expected to submit an abstract/present a poster or talk
+ Abstract draft must be submitted to Stephanie to review at least 1 week before submission
+ A practice talk or draft poster should be presented to the lab/Stephanie at least + All lab members are expected to seek out and apply for other funding opportunities, including through societies, conferences, and the university
+ During the conference, lab members are expected to attend the majority of talks, poster sessions, and scientific events
